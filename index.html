                    A 3D character refers to a digital model of a character that is created using 3D computer graphics
                    software. This type of character is often used in video games, movies, and other forms of digital
                    media.

                    3D characters are typically created by digital artists who use specialized software to create a
                    model of the character, which includes all the details such as the shape of the body, facial
                    features, and clothing. The model can then be animated and used in various media.

                    One of the advantages of using 3D characters is that they can be manipulated and viewed from any
                    angle, making them very versatile for use in different types of media. Additionally, 3D characters
                    can be created to be incredibly lifelike, making them ideal for use in movies or other visual
                    storytelling mediums where realism is important.
